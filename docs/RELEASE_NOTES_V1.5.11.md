# Ages of Calradia v1.5.11

This release preserves the user-approved political-map renderer exactly while
shipping calendar, economy, campaign pacing, and UI fixes in an isolated
compatibility sidecar.

## Fixes

- Tournaments resume spawning and ending on the extended calendar.
- Workshop production respects the adopted calendar cadence without breaking
  perk, policy, or building modifiers.
- Siege preparation and siege-engine work use the same configurable campaign
  time scale as the visible clock.
- Troop wages and clan-finance UI show effective Gregorian daily values without
  double-scaling the amount charged.
- War proposal cadence uses the corrected 87-day post-peace cooldown.
- Marriage, allegiance, kingdom, and similar scene notifications use valid
  Gregorian dates.
- World Events UI strategic-map town names remain visible at every zoom and use
  a larger readable label. Campaign-map settlement names still disappear when
  the political overview begins at altitude 580.

## Builds

- `AgesOfCalradia-v1.5.11.zip` is the clean player release.
- `AgesOfCalradia-v1.5.11-Test.zip` is a prerelease test build with World Events
  alignment diagnostics and matching sidecar symbols.

Both archives require Bannerlord Native v1.4.8 and contain the approved main
DLL SHA-256 `560F1B5181F8CC2EFE51564D8675FD3089E722606FA55B0B166D36ECD9868D8E`.

Remove an older `AgesOfCalradia` module folder before extracting the selected
archive into Bannerlord's `Modules` directory. Do not install both archives at
the same time.
